# Landing Page Mockup
This one page website is based on a design from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2786449-Liendo-Multipurpose-Landing-Page-Template/attachments/569352). It's built using:
- Foundation 6
- Sass
- Slick
- Font Awesome

Some of the Foundation component used include:
- Top Bar
- Block Grid
- Magellan
- Sticky Navigation
- Abide plugin for form validation

Also featured are some great pictures of doughnuts and Lord of the Rings references. I really enjoyed working on this project and making it look as similar to the design from Dribbble as possible.
