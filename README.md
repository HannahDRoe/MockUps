# Landing Page Mockup
This one page website is based on a design from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2786449-Liendo-Multipurpose-Landing-Page-Template/attachments/569352). It's built using:
- Foundation 6
- Sass
- [Slick carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

Some of the Foundation component used include:
- Top Bar
- Magellan
- Sticky Navigation

Also featured are some great pictures of doughnuts and Lord of the Rings references. I really enjoyed working on this project and making it look as similar to the design from Dribbble as possible.


#### Updated December 1st, 2017
Main focus of this refactor was:
- to update Foundation version
- make responsive styles neater
- utilized flexbox
